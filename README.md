## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
 I am doing the 30-day challenge of [JavaScript30](javaScript30.com) to learn JavaScript.

 ## The Challenge

 # Day 1
  - Some keys are shown on the screen.
  - If the user clicks on those keys or presses the same keys on the keyboard.
  - Some CSS will be applied to the selected key and an audio specific to the key   will be played.

# Day 2
 - Build a analog and digital clock, which will show the current time.
