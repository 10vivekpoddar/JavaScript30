## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am doing the 30-day challenge of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) to learn JavaScript.

## The Challenge

### [Day 1](/Day01)

- Some keys are shown on the screen.
- If the user clicks on those keys or presses the same keys on the keyboard.
- Some CSS will be applied to the selected key and an audio specific to the key will be played.

### [Day 2](/Day02/)

- Build a analog and digital clock, which will show the current time.
